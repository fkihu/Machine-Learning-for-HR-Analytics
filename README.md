# Machine-Learning-for-HR-Analytics
A machine learning solution to automate the process of shortlisting candidates eligible for promotion.

# Background Information
HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading
to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using
analytics for years. However, the collection, processing, and analysis of data have been
largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the
approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments
woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game.
# Problem Statement
Your client is a large Multinational Corporation, and they have nine broad verticals
across the organization. One of the problems your client faces is identifying the right
people for promotion (only for the manager position and below) and preparing them in
time.
Currently the process, they are following is:
● They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past
performance.
● Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for
each vertical.
● These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical. At the end of the
program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion
(only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., the
employee gets a promotion.
For the process mentioned above, the final promotions are only announced after the
evaluation, and this leads to a delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, the company
needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that
they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
They have provided multiple attributes around employees’ past and current performance
along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at a
checkpoint will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.
